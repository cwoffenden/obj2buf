# (Reasonably) High-poly Test Files

Files with around 65k unique verts, 100k+ triangles. `teapot-65k.fbx` was generated in 3ds Max, a 44 segment teapot _primitive_. `trex-65k.fbx` was created in Zbrush by Paul Vera-Broadbent at Numfum GmbH (the original file has 1.2 million polys, its intended use is as a baked low-poly test file for internal projects).
