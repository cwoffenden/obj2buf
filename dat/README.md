# Test Files

Collection of simple test files. `bunny.obj` and its variants are takes on the [Stanford Bunny](//graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/), processed in [Marmoset Toolbag](//marmoset.co/toolbag/) before being exported from 3ds Max (to test triangulation and orientation). The cube, quad, torus and spheres are simple Max primitives. Teapots are from Max and Modo.
